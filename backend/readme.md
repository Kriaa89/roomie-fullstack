## üéØ Project Overview

**RentMate** is a Tinder-style web application designed to streamline the process of finding housing or roommates. Users can swipe through property and user profiles to find a match, just like in a dating app. The platform supports three main roles:

- **Renter**: Searching for a room or home to rent.
- **Owner / Landlord**: Renting out a property they own.
- **Roommate-Host**: Already renting a house and looking for a roommate to share the space.

Additionally, owners can define the type of tenant they‚Äôre looking for (e.g., students, workers, families, women-only, etc.). Users can switch roles as needed.

## üîö Conclusion

RentMate combines swipe-based simplicity with deep functionality. From role flexibility and audience targeting to calendar scheduling, AI assistance, and verified identities, it creates a modern, secure, and intelligent rental experience.

# Roomie Fullstack Application

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing an issue in the role selection component where users would see the error message "Failed to get user information". This occurred because the frontend was trying to call an API endpoint `/api/users/me` that didn't exist in the backend.

## Solution

The solution involved implementing the missing endpoint in the backend:

1. Added a `getCurrentUser()` method to the `UserService` class that:
   - Gets the authenticated user's email from the security context
   - Retrieves the user from the database using the email
   - Converts the user entity to a DTO for safe transmission to the client

2. Added a `/api/users/me` endpoint to the `UserController` class that:
   - Calls the `getCurrentUser()` method from the service
   - Returns the user information with appropriate error handling

## Frontend Integration

The frontend already has the code to call this endpoint in the `ApiService`:

```
getCurrentUser(): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.get(`${this.baseUrl}/api/users/me`, { headers: this.getAuthHeaders() });
}
```

This method is used in both the `RoleSelectionComponent` and `DashboardComponent` to get the current user's information.

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Log in with valid credentials
4. Navigate to the role selection page
5. Verify that the user information is loaded correctly and no error message is displayed

## Additional Notes

- The JWT authentication system is working correctly, with tokens being properly generated and validated
- The error was purely due to a missing endpoint in the backend
- No changes were needed to the frontend code as it was already correctly implemented
