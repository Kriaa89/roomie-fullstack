# RentMate Platform Development Guidelines

### Overview
**RentMate** is a rental platform connecting **Renters**, **Roommate Hosts**, and **Property Owners**. This document provides technical guidelines for both backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (Angular) development.

---

## üîß Backend
**Framework:** Spring Boot (Java 17, MySQL)  
**Key Features:**
- Fully role-specific architecture (no mock data).
- Separate models, controllers, and services for each role.

### üìÇ Entities
1. **AppUser (Shared)**
   - Common fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`, `role` (RENTER, OWNER, ROOMMATE_HOST), `phoneNumber`, `emailVerified`.

2. **Profiles (Role-Specific)**
   - **RenterProfile:** Bio, city, profile picture, `skillsExpected`, `lifestylePreferences`, visibility settings.
   - **RoommateHostProfile:** Similar structure, but with `skillsOffered`.
   - **OwnerProfile:** Minimal fields (city, profile picture).

3. **Listings (Role-Specific)**
   - **RoomListings:** Created by Roommate Hosts (e.g., title, description, price, city, host).
   - **PropertyListings:** Created by Owners (similar structure).

4. **Interactions**
   - **SwipeLike:** Tracks user likes/dislikes/matches.
   - **VisitRequest:** Manages visit scheduling/confirmation.
   - **Notification:** Alerts users about matches, visit requests, etc.

### üì¶ Controllers/Services
Design RESTful APIs for profile, listing management, and user interactions, including:

| **Controller**               | **Purpose**                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `AuthController`              | User registration & JWT-based login.            |
| `ProfileControllers`          | CRUD for Renter, Host, and Owner profiles.       |
| `ListingControllers`          | CRUD for Room and Property Listings.            |
| `SwipeController`             | Manage likes/dislikes and detect matches.       |
| `VisitRequestController`      | Handle visit requests (date, time, responses).  |
| `NotificationController`      | Manage read/unread notifications.               |

**Security Notes:**
- **Role Validation:** Restrict route access based on user role.
- **Dropdowns Only:** Skills/lifestyle fields always use dropdowns, no free text allowed.

---

## üåê Frontend
**Frameworks:** Angular 17, Bootstrap/Tailwind  
**Development Requirements:**
- No inline HTML/CSS.
- Separate files for logic (`.ts`), layout (`.html`), and styles (`.css`).
- Use `HttpClient` for API calls.
- Implement JWT Interceptor for token-based authentication.

---

### Key Components
#### üîê **Auth Flow**
- **LandingPage:** Welcome screen.
- **Login & Register Components:** Multi-step registration (select role as RENTER/OWNER/ROOMMATE_HOST).

#### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Renter Dashboard**
| **Component**           | **Purpose**                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `RenterDashboard`        | Main renter interface.                              |
| `RenterProfile`          | Manage bio, skills, lifestyle preferences.          |
| `SwipeComponent`         | Tinder-style card swipes for hosts.                 |
| `MatchList`              | List of confirmed matches.                          |
| `VisitRequest`           | Schedule visits (date/time picker).                 |

#### üë• **Host Dashboard**
| **Component**       | **Purpose**                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `HostDashboard`      | Central hub for hosts.                                 |
| `HostProfile`        | Manage skills offered and lifestyle.                   |
| `MyListings`         | Post/manage co-living rooms.                           |
| `SwipeRequests`      | Accept/decline incoming likes from renters.            |
| `MatchList`          | View matched renters.                                  |

#### üè† **Owner Dashboard**
| **Component**       | **Purpose**                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `OwnerDashboard`     | Minimal UI for property owners.                        |
| `OwnerProfile`       | Edit basic profile info (city, picture).               |
| `MyListings`         | Create and manage Property Listings.                   |
| `Notifications`      | Receive visit and match alerts.                        |

#### ‚úÖ **Shared Components**
- **NavbarComponent**: Dynamic based on role.
- **ToastNotification**: Alert for matches or visit requests.
- **VisitRequestComponent**: Shared logic for scheduling visits.

---

## üîí Security/Technical Requirements
- Role-based route guards (e.g., only Roommate Hosts can access `/swipe-requests`).
- Use JWT Interceptor to attach tokens to API calls automatically.
- Profile and listings forms must use **Reactive Forms**.
- **Dropdown fields only**: Skills/lifestyle should not accept free text.
- Avoid hardcoded/mocked data; rely on dynamic API data.
